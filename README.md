Godoc-readme is a CLI that generates a README.md file for your go project using comments you already write!

> [!WARNING]
> This package is still under developement. The API may change, some features may be broken or incomplete.

In fact, this README.md file was generated using godoc-readme! :open_mouth:

Godoc-Readme is built using the [packages package](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/packages) from the go tools. It uses your existing
[godoc comments](https://go.dev/blog/godoc) that you're already writing in your code to generate your READMEs... You are writing comments...right?

Add a package doc like:

```go
//This first line will be a title
//Then everything else will be rendered at the top of the readme, you can format me as markdown!
package your_package_name
```

Then simply run the following command in your package to generate the readme file! It's that simple!

```shell
godoc-readme
```

Checkout the [CLI README](./cmd/README.md) for help with using the tool, including customizing the output formatting.

## Installing:

Run the following command to install godoc-readme

```shell

    go install github.com/dubbikins/godoc-readme@latest

```

> [!TIP]
> Use the `//go:generate godoc-readme -r` directive in your module root to generate a README.md file for your packages when the `go generate` command is run.

### Alerts

You can add [Github Markdown Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) to your readme by utilizing the notes syntax in your godoc comments.
Godoc-readme support _in-line_ alerts in your ***packages*** godoc comments OR single-line alerts that "target" a the package or a `Type`, `Func`, `Method`, `Var`, or `Const`. Targeted types, besides a package, cannot have inlined alerts because their doc strings are nested by default, use targets for these types instead.
If you want to change this behaviour, you can provide your own template for custom rendering logic.

The following alert types are supported:

- `NOTE`
- `WARNING`
- `IMPORTANT`
- `CAUTION`
- `TIP`

Syntax:

    // TYPE(target): text

    Where `type` is one of the supported alert types and `target` is the name of the *package* or an exported *Type, Func, Method, Var, or Const in the package* that you want to target with the note.
    A single-line "targeted" Note will appear after the target's doc string section in the README.md file while in-line notes will appear in-line of the doc string.
    Targeted notes must be on a single line and must begin with a space.

> [!WARNING]
> An in-line alert cannot have whitespace before it's declaration or it will be rendered as plain doc string text while a targeted alert must have one space before it's declaration.

> [!TIP]
> In-line alerts are great for enhancing your documentaion in large godoc comments that you want to control the placement of the alert
while single-line alerts are great for adding a note to a specific type, func, method, var, or const in your package. Since a single-line alert doesn't have to be collocated with the target, you can add targeted alerts from anywhere in your package.
